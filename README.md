# DC Circuit Nodal Voltage Solver

  <p align="center">
    Has a rudimentary UI which lets user build a DC circuit by clicking tiles until they get their desired component. After circuit is built, the UI representation of the circuit is traversed by breadth-first traversal, in order to find the nodes and their connections. With this, a system of linear equations is created and solved via Gaussian elimination.

## About The Project
This was my first project ever made. I wrote this while I was still in Biochemistry, and was just watching youtube videos on how to code. I didn't use a graph because I didn't know what it was at the time. Instead it's all arrays and keeping track of indices.
It was a difficult project and took me a lot of time to figure out how exactly it was all going to work. In the end, it was a fun experience!
